This is a personal experiment to learn how to develop a visual programming interface using [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly). Therefore it does not aim to become a fully functional LOGO implementation.

If you want to use a web interface for the LOGO programing language, I strongly suggest using Suglar Labs' [Turtle Blocks](https://turtle.sugarlabs.org/).
